Shelf Space Allocation Problem is the problem of finding the optimal solution (or a good solution) for arranging products (or objects) on shelves in a store/warehouse to maximize profit, the problem considers different shelves with different priorities based on customer experience studies or based on certain criteria defined by the warehouse manager, while the products have different dimensions and different profit margin. 
The problem can be described in a complicated context, with many demands and aggregations, and several rules, and can also be simplified and the solution is generalized for more complicated rules.
Our solution will solve this problem and present planograms in motion to show the change of the solution and the improvements while still satisfying the criteria of fitting all the objects within the minimum and maximum limits, the solution at hand can be generalized for more complicated scenarios where similar products can be stacked on top of each other, and have a certain depth count in each allocation.
The problem is a large scale optimization NP Hard problem, the solution here will present different approaches in the implementation for the same algorithm using LNS Largest Neighborhood Heuristics Search that shows how some are faster than others and all yield an improved arrangement from scratch given the products/shelves/priorities data set.
Using LNS Large neighborhood Search to SSAP.
