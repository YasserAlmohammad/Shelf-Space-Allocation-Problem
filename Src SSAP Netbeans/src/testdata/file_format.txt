#N M S
#N: first number indicates number of prodcuts, thus parser should read N lines
#M: second number indicates how many shelf parts there is, thus parser must read M lines afterwards
#S: third number (width of a shelf in cm)
#first N lines have the following format
#ID(int)  facing_length_in_cm(int) minmum_facing_required(int) maximum_facing_required(int) profit(double)
#second M lines have the following format
#ID(int) shelf_id(int) priority_co_shelf(double) priority_co_part(double)
